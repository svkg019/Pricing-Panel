# Pricing-Panel
This project showcases my skills in HTML and CSS by creating a responsive and attractive pricing table webpage.
The webpage displays different pricing plans, tiers and subscription levels for a hypothetical service,
along with the features and benefits of each option. The webpage also uses flexbox, color, typography and layout to highlight the best value plan
and to guide the userâ€™s attention. The webpage is compatible with different screen sizes and devices, and follows the web design principles
of simplicity, clarity and consistency.
